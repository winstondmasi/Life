# Life

The Game of Life was created by mathematician John Conway in 1970. This is also an example of a cellular automaton, and also of a zero-player "game". Conway's game of life is played on an infinite grid of square cells governed by a set of rules. The game consists of a two-dimensional world of cells extending infinitely in all directions, divided into "cells". Each cell is either "dead" or "alive" at a given "generation". The game consists of a set of rules that determine the fate of each cell in the next generation, i.e., how the cell evolves from generation to generation. These rules calculate the state of a cell in the next generation as a function of the states of its neighboring cells in the current generation.

Conway's set of rules are summarized as:
- A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
- A live cell with more than three live neighbors also dies.
- A live cell with exactly two or three live neighbors lives.
- A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive.

Even though the rules are simple, the game generates an unpredictable pattern of cells and unpredictable behavior.
